                <h2>La Belle</h2>
                <p>The film begins before the war in France, where Rick, a married man, 
                    good-doer and an attorney of law, encounters Lois in Paris for the first time. 
                    He gives up everything for her when she walks out on him at La Belle Aurore, turning 
                    his life upside down and leaving him with nothing to believe in.</p>

                <h2>Cafe American</h2>
                <p>By 1941, the war is raging across Europe and Rick is now the owner of a classy nightclub 
                    called Caf√© American in the Morrocan port of Casablanca. Having no political allegiances to 
                    either side, he turns a blind eye to the shady dealings of opportunists who promise escape passage 
                    for the right price while serving up champagne to the Gestapo. One evening, he gets a visit from a 
                    French Officer who tells him that a very important man called Victor Laszlo is coming to the bar and 
                    is willing to pay a huge sum of money for two exit visas.</p>

                <h2>Everybody comes to Rick's</h2>
                <p>One for him and one for his companion, a lady travelling with him but that under no circumstances should he 
                    be allowed get them as he is wanted by the Gestapo. His friendship with the French Officer leads him to make a 
                    friendly wager that the man will escape, leaving the woman behind. This wager will change the course of everything 
                    for Rick, forcing him to confront his past and risk everything again for the woman he loves but took everything from him.</p>
