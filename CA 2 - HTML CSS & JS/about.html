                <h2>Cafe American - Review</h2>
                <p>The director maintains the balance of melodrama and suspense in this film while recapturing the storytelling of the classic Casablanca with a modern
                    twist. It is an intense World War II spy thriller combined with love, mystery and intrigue.</p>
                
                <p>With a lush, globe-spanning aesthetic and some compelling wartime action - not to mention a romance brought to life by two supremely talented 
                    and charismatic performers - there's a lot to like here.  Both stars have a gentle and compelling onscreen chemistry and together sell the 
                    love and the intrigue perfect for any rainy day romantics.</p>
